NETFLIX AND CHILL is now a millenial word that we very often hear to. But what if we always have to scroll millions of pages to get to where we wanted to. It's tiring . So we build a reccomendation function which basically recommends the content according to the interested genre.

# Prerequisites üë®‚Äçüíª

### Install Google Collab notebook
Refer to https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrKAh3yW9BiNGoskd27HAx.;_ylu=Y29sbwNzZzMEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Ny/RV=2/RE=1657850994/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fcolab.research.google.com%2fnotebook/RK=2/RS=tsQEYcTikT6aQ8cIwhtaVJZrRgM- to install Google collab

### Get the dataset 
Refer to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satpreetmakhija/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows-2021?resource=download to get the data set

### Used Libraries
Numpy,Pandas,ntlk,re,sklearn,etc.

### About The project
In this project we used the Python programming language to analyze the dataset given to us as per the viwers watchlists fom kaggle.Now using different libraries we just first cleared the separations , Nullspaces,etc inorder to get a clean data ready for our use out of the dataset.Then we used the data to recommend people on the basis of genre using cosine similarity.


## How we built it üßë‚Äçüíª
We used Different python libraries to first clean out the data given to us and basically get it in the form we need.Now using the COSINE SIMILARITY  we find out the similarities and here the recommendation function works on the basis of GENRE.so now using and processing the data the function recommends the netflix shows or movies.

## What we learned ü§ì
Being a enthusiastic student i  learnt about using python and its libraries , in order to build a real reccomendation engine and using the cosine similarity feature.

## Built With üíï 
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Google Colab
